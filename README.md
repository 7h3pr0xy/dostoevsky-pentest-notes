# Dostoevsky's Pentest Notes

This is my attempt to not suck at pentesting by organizing my learning.

Things I've learned so far:

1. It's pretty hard to organize data at this scale manually.
2. Security is a constantly evolving landscape and it's hard to keep up if you try to learn everything so stick to one focus at a time.
3. Don't neglect the people in life who care about you. It's easy to get obsessed with this field and get sucked into a rabbit hole of endless learning, but put it down sometimes.
