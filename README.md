# Dostoevsky's Pentest Notes

This is my attempt to not suck at pentesting by organizing my learning.

Things I've learned so far:

1. It's pretty hard to organize data at this scale manually. So don't try to finish what has literally become the size of a screenplay all in one sitting. Babysteps.
2. Security is a constantly evolving landscape and it's hard to keep up if you try to learn everything, so stick to one focus at a time. There is plenty of time to dive into all the interesting concepts, but you need to build fundamentals first \(walk before you run\)
3. It pays off to take your mind off of the problem sometimes - don't neglect the people in life who care about you. It's easy to get obsessed with this field and get sucked into a rabbit hole of endless learning, but put it down sometimes and go crack a beer with the wife/gf/kid/friend.
4. Network. Network. Network. LinkedIn. Twitter. is. amazing. to. network. with. your. industry. This industry is more about the people you know than anything else. It's tight knit and your geek network can land you in some really favorable situations. Get to know people, engage with them. Take an interest in what they are doing. If you're an introvert take a few steps out of your shell, don't worry you can always run back in to recharge ;\)!
5. Bounce your ideas off people! - find people you can speak with on any given topic because there will be times when you have specific questions you won't be able to google for and you'll learn better in that individual setting than you will reading a million PDFs/watching videos/etc
6. Try to practice and hopefully master one small concept every couple of days to keep with the flow. I found myself taking month long breaks and doing nothing but playing video games, it's a vicious cycle of apathy when you stop doing this because it's hard to nuzzle your way back into the frame of mind, at least that was the case for me.
