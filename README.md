# Dostoevsky's Pentest Notes

This is my attempt to not suck at pentesting by organizing my learning.

Things I've learned so far:

1. It's pretty hard to organize data at this scale manually. So don't try to finish what has literally become the size of a screenplay all in one sitting. Babysteps.
2. Security is a constantly evolving landscape and it's hard to keep up if you try to learn everything, so stick to one focus at a time. There is plenty of time to dive into all the interesting concepts, but you need to build fundamentals first \(walk before you run\)
3. It pays off to take your mind off of the problem sometimes - don't neglect the people in life who care about you. It's easy to get obsessed with this field and get sucked into a rabbit hole of endless learning, but put it down sometimes and go crack a beer with the wife/gf/kid/friend.
4. Twitter. is. amazing. to. network. with. your. industry.
